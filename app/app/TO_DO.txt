To do:
- error handling for a wrong email or password on login
- error handling for sign up page (bad password/wrong phone num format/wrong email format.two users can't have the same email or phone number)
- error handling sign up page should only redirect to homepage when the sign up button is pressesd and a new user has been created correctly (meaning all the fields are correct)
    currently one can enter the app with the wrong/no info

Nage:
CRUD -> needs delete acc feature
