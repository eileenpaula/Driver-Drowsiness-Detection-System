# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System

## File Changes
- camera.tsx : ahs 2 errors with comments beside them but it still runs okay. Figure out what the errors are later.
- camera page is mostly done. Testing and debugging needed with the actual db to feed values to it

Future Plans:
1. Adjust the Setting page so that it is functional.
2. Build Profile page
3. Build Stats page -->requires model data

Extra:
Possibly add high def product logo
Possibly revamp color schemes, fonts, spacing, etc, if needed/have time
