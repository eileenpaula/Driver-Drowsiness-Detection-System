# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System

## File Changes
- index.tsx -> reset the template of the app to something basic -> comments of change in file

- _layouts.tsx -> reset the template of the app to something basic -> there was a stranger header showing for each page so it's property was set to false to hide it (check this in branch merging...)

- images directory -> added LOGO.png

Future Plans:
1. Build Stats page
2. Build Camera page
3. Making the camera button route to a camera page and the settings button route to the setting page.
4. Adding the route to the stats page.
Extra:
Possibly add high def product logo
Possibly revamp color schemes, fonts, spacing, etc.
